## The Task
This GitHub repository is designed to solve the Unity ML-Agents Tennis Environment.

## The environment
![Unity ML-Agents Tennis Environment](Pictures/Tennist.gif)

The agent in this repository is designed to move a double-jointed arm to a stiring target location. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each timestep that the agent's hand is in the goal location. The goal of the agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector including four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.
